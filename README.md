# What is Flask-Secrets? ![CI](https://github.com/nickjj/flask-secrets/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

It's a Flask CLI extension that makes it easy to generate secure secret keys
and tokens.

After installing it you'll be able to run `flask secrets` to generate a number
of tokens that you can use for your `SECRET_KEY`, database passwords, API keys,
auth tokens or whatever else you need secret tokens for.

## Installation

`pip3 install Flask-Secrets`

That's it!

There's no need to even import or initialize anything in your Flask app because
it's just a CLI command that gets added to your Flask app.

*But if you're curious, a complete example Flask app can be found in the
[tests/
directory](https://github.com/nickjj/flask-secrets/tree/master/tests/example_app).*

#### Requirements:

- Python 3.6+
- Flask 1.0+

## Ensuring the `secrets` command is available

You'll want to make sure to at least set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable:

```sh
# Replace `hello.app` with your app's name.
export FLASK_APP=hello.app
export FLASK_ENV=development
```

Then run the `flask` binary to see its help menu:

```sh

Usage: flask [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  ...

Commands:
  secrets  Generate a set of random secret tokens.
```

If all went as planned you should see the new `secrets` command added to your
list of commands.

## Going over the `secrets` command

Running `flask secrets --help` will produce this help menu:

```sh
Usage: flask secrets [OPTIONS]

  Generate a set of random secret tokens.

  They are suitable for your SECRET_KEY, passwords, API keys and more.

Options:
  --length INTEGER  Character length.  [default: 99]
  --count INTEGER   Generate N tokens.  [default: 10]
  --prefix TEXT     1 or more key prefixes.  [default: dev_, test_, prod_]
  --help            Show this message and exit.

```

And if you run `flask secrets`, you'll end up with something like this by
default:

```sh

There's 1 token on each line and they're generated with uppercase / lowercase
letters and digits.

#### 30 random tokens

By default you'll get 10 tokens for each environment you might run your app in.
Each token can be used individually however you see fit across any environment.
They are not associated to each other in any way shape or form.

## FAQ

### Why are the tokens prefixed with dev, test and prod?

This is a convention I took from Stripe. I really like how Stripe's keys
include prefixes like `pk_test_`, `sk_test_`, `pk_live_` and `sk_live_`. At a
glance you can tell what type of key it's for and what environment it's
associated to.

By default this tool prefixes each environment you might run your app in. You
can always customize the prefixes by passing in 1 or more prefix flags, such as
`--prefix apples_ --prefix oranges_`. You can also do `--prefix ""` to omit any
type of prefix.

### Why did you generate 10 tokens for each prefix?

Most real world applications will require having at least a `SECRET_KEY`, 
PostgreSQL password and maybe a Redis password too.

That puts us at needing at least 3 tokens. If you happen to be doing client
work you might find yourself creating additional passwords for various services
too. It adds up!

If this tool only generated 1 token at a time then you would need to run it a
bunch of times. 10 seemed like a reasonable balance between being enough for
most apps and not being obnoxiously long in terms of output.

You can always customize the count with `--count 3` to generate however many
tokens you want.

### Why did you pick 99 characters as a length?

It's what Stripe uses when generating their API keys. When it comes to security,
the last thing you want to do is guess at stuff or undershoot the length.

Chances are they put a lot of thought into that value and 99 chars should not
be crackable for many trillions of years!

If you use a prefix, it really comes out to be 99 + the prefix's length too.
The prefix gets prepended to the token after it's been generated with whatever
the length value is.

If 99 isn't enough, you can always customize it with `--length 128`.

### Why did you limit tokens to letters and digits?

Technically Python3 supports generating URL safe tokens that include
underscores and hyphens, but I chose against that because if you decide to
prefix your tokens such as `prod_`, then I didn't want to worry about maybe
wanting to parse those tokens later by splitting on an underscore and then
ending up with more than 2 items in the split list.

That and it's what Stripe does too. Again, you can't go too wrong following
their standards!

If you're interested in learning Flask I have a 20+ hour video course called
[Build a SAAS App with
Flask](https://buildasaasappwithflask.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=flasksecrets&utm_campaign=readme).
It's a course where we build a real world SAAS app. Everything about the course
